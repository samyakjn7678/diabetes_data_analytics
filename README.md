## Introduction

This project is focused on analyzing a diabetes dataset. The analysis includes exploring the distribution of diabetes by various attributes, identifying patterns, and providing insightful visualizations to better understand the factors influencing diabetes.

## Dataset

- *File*: diabetes_data.csv
- *Description*: This dataset contains information about various health metrics and their relationship to diabetes, including features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and more, along with the outcome indicating whether a patient has diabetes.

## Usage

1. *Upload the Notebook*:
    - Open Google Colab and upload the `diabetes_data_analytics_project.ipynb` notebook.

2. *Run the Notebook*:
    - Run the cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis.
    - You will be prompted to upload the `diabetes_data.csv` file during the notebook execution.

## Analysis and Visualizations

The analysis includes:

- *Number of Diabetes Cases by Outcome*: Visualized using count plots to show the count of diabetes cases by outcome.
- *Age Distribution of Patients*: Histograms to show the age distribution of patients.
- *Glucose Levels by Diabetes Outcome*: Box plots to show the glucose levels by diabetes outcome.
- *Correlation Heatmap*: Heatmap to show the correlation between different features.
- *Pairplot of the Dataset*: Pairwise relationships and distributions for all features, colored by the outcome.
- *BMI Distribution*: Histograms to show the distribution of BMI values.
- *Blood Pressure Distribution*: Histograms to show the distribution of blood pressure values.
- *Scatter Plot of Glucose vs. Insulin*: Scatter plot to visualize the relationship between glucose and insulin levels.
